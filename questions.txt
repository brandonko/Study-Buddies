Our inspiration for Study Buddies came from our need to have a free platform for students to communicate with one another. There is not free platform that offers a free chatting service integrated with blog posting capabilities.
Study Buddies is accessible for students across the world from all universities. Students can signup, choose the university they attend, and then choose the class specific chatroom/blog posting room. This application is a Node.js based application that utilizes Express as the Node framework. The web app uses MongoDB for data storage with server side rendering using Pug/Jade. The whole application is bootstrapped and utilizes CDNs.
Our team worked very well together where each person had strengths that complemented each others.
